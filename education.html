        <p>My formal education started in Marsh Gibbon CofE Primary School, where my aspiration for information formed from having teachers that really bonded with me. After this, I attended The Bicester School, being in the highest sets in the majority of classes throughout my time there. My GCSE results were as follows: Maths – 9, Music – Distinction 2, Computer Science – 8, Language – 8, Combined Science – 8+7, Geography – 6, Spanish – 6, Literature – 6. After this I attended Banbury College doing their Games Development and Coding Level 3 course, of which I am currently in the final months of. After this I will be attending Bletchley College’s Software Design HNC course.</p>

        <p>In my spare time, I like to learn about lots of different things, ranging from world geography and history to movies, actors, and directors. From ages 6-12 I attended Lynx Gymnasium in Aylesbury, only leaving once I had completed every goal and challenge set. From ages 7-12 I practiced the trumpet, achieving a Grade 3, before becoming disinterested. I attended Scouts for little over a year before leaving due to feeling that the authority figures there didn’t control the others from misbehaving well. Since the start of 2023 I’ve been learning Polish as it is the most common language for someone to speak in England besides English. Whilst doing GCSE computing, there was an aspect of coding in Python that I adored, and I learnt how to use that more, and sometimes made my own small programs in my spare time at home.</p>
