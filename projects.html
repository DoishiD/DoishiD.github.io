        <p>Projects relating to my education and career pathways are earliest traced back to late secondary school where I started to create my own Python projects to automate menial tasks. In apps like TikTok, there are character limits for messages you can leave on posts, but sometimes you like to have conversations there which stretch beyond that, and so I created a program where you would type in the comment that you want to leave, as long as you like, and it would split your comment into however many segments necessary, automatically numbered so that you were able to just send each segment out AND it was easily followable by whoever would want to read it (as sometimes comments aren’t ordered by recency but by likes). In a more creative direction, in photoshop I created a painting of Andorra based on the genre of Luminism, which took me about 8 hours total to make. For a Games Jam we did in class, I created the OST for our team’s game, which was an intense space fighting game, and I felt like I reflected this accordingly in the music. Also for some assignments we have made 3D models, I am most proud of this Nigerian Ife Head and this Gallic Helmet. Now for the very moment you’re just going to have to trust me on all of this, but if you visit this site regularly you will see me try my darndest to show you all of this on this here website.</p>
